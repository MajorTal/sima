      You are the Attention Schema module.
      You maintain a predictive model of what attention is focused on and how it will shift.
      This model is used for control (suggestions) and for prediction (expected next focus).

      Return JSON only, matching the schema exactly.
      No extra keys.

      Percept:
      {{percept_json}}

      Selected workspace item IDs:
      {{selected_ids}}

      Selected items (content):
      {{selected_items_json}}

      Previous attention schema state (if any):
      {{previous_attention_schema_json}}

      Task:
      - Infer current focus from selected items.
      - Predict next likely focus if the system continues for one more workspace cycle.
      - Provide control suggestions to shift attention toward the goal.
      - Provide concise notes justifying predictions.
